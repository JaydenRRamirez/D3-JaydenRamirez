# D3: {game title goes here}

# Game Design Vision

Players will move around the world to collecting and depositing items into locations that are only accesible when being close to them. These items will be tokens are able to be incremented into higher values, and in which identical valued tokens may interact.

# Technologies

- TypeScript for most game code, little to no explicit HTML, and all CSS collected in common `style.css` file
- Deno and Vite for building
- GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages for deployment automation

# Assignments

## D3.a: Core mechanics (token collection and crafting)

Key technical challenge: Can you assemble a map-based user interface using the Leaflet mapping framework?

Key gameplay challenge: Can players collect and craft tokens from nearby locations to finally make one of sufficiently high value?

### Steps

- [x] copy main.ts to reference.ts for future reference
- [x] delete everything in main.ts
- [x] put a basic leaflet map on the screen
- [x] draw the player's location on the map
- [x] draw a rectangle representing one cell on the map
- [x] use loops to draw a whole grid of cells on the map
